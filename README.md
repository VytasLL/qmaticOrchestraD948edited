This is modified Qmatic UTT file.
New parameter is added: "Change workstation number by"
Main display will take servicepointLogicId and will add this number.

For example. 
If you have second floor and workstation numbers are from 1-5 (just labels) but workstation ID is 11-15 then your main dispay will show incorrect information. Using this UTT you can define how many numbers to add/substract.
In this case you need set "Change workstation number by" to -10
